  sentences:
  - Oh, hi! My name is Nala. Shadow and Cloud spoke very well about you!
  - They commented that you are a diamond that need to be cut if you want to continue
    in this business, hehe.
  - Well, I'm here because I need an acessory.
  - I've been cast in a role as a tree in the theater and I need your help...
  - I don't feel like this is the best role I could play...
  - But anyway, what do you have to offer me?
  - I see you have an amazing variety of items in your store.
  - How about clicking the arrows and checking your stock?
  - I can also try on the items if you click on them, and if you think they're good,
    just hit confirm and I'll be ready to go to my appointment!
